What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
 A .git file is created. it needs to be done for us to have a file repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a package which combines all the files to be commited in one stop. Working directory is the actual set of files after commit is performed.

It brings a lot of value as each commit can happen in more than one file. Also its nice


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
All the logical changes can be added to the statging area then finally once commit can be made into it.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
when we want to try out some new features and when multiple language fetures required.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Diagrams helps to visualize all the branches and commit history for a repository.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Code merge will happen


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling Automatically will overwrite any local changes, to avoid remote getting overwritten, its better to pull manually

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork to take from one git hub and put it in my own repo
Branch to work on a new feature without altering master
CLone to take copy of github for first time


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Merge can happen without any issues


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Easy to make our changes reach to others. Harder when multiple people works on the same code at the same time.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When we want to try out some new feature without affecting master, we will create branch.
